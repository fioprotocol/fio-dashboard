          Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy
          Rights

        We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy

        <u>Verification process</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
        our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
        information so that we can match it with information you have previously
        provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit,
        we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
        information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
        we may contact you through a communication method (e.g.,&nbsp;phone or
        email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
        verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
        your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible,
        we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
        purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity
        from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you
        provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
        identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
        such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
        you.

            You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal

            than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.
